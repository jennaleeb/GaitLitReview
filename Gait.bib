abstract = {The goal of this thesis was to explore the usability of on-foot sensors for ambulatory gait analysis. Using a human factors engineering approach, two different ambulatory gait analysis prototypes were assessed in two separate studies. The first study was conducted with student participants in a university setting and the second study was conducted in-situ with neurorehabilitation patients at Bridgepoint Hospital. The usability and patient experience of the prototypes were assessed, and based on these findings a set of recommendations was developed. These issues and recommendations are detailed in this thesis and are expected to inform the design of future iterations of the prototypes.},

The techniques are based on the detection of the magnetic fringe field of a magnetically labeled biomolecule interacting with a complementary biomolecule bound to a magnetic-field sensor. Magnetoresistive-based sensors, conventionally used as read heads in hard disk drives, have been used in combination with biologically functionalized magnetic labels to demonstrate the detection of molecular recognition. Real-world bio-applications are now being investigated, enabling tailored device design, based on sensor and label characteristics. This detection platform provides a robust, inexpensive sensing technique with high sensitivity and considerable scope for quantitative signal data, enabling magnetoresistive biochips to meet specific diagnostic needs that are not met by existing technologies.},

The current paper reviews available wearable sensors and ambulatory gait analysis methods based on the various wearable sensors. After an introduction of the gait phases, the principles and features of wearable sensors used in gait analysis are provided. The gait analysis methods based on wearable sensors is divided into gait kinematics, gait kinetics, and electromyography. Studies on the current methods are reviewed, and applications in sports, rehabilitation, and clinical diagnosis are summarized separately.

abstract = {OBJECTIVES: To evaluate how cognitive function and divided attention affect gait in Alzheimer's disease (AD). DESIGN: Cross-sectional intervention study with subjects serving as their own controls. SETTING: Inpatient unit and outpatient clinic for patients with dementia located at a Veterans Affairs Medical Center. PARTICIPANTS: Twenty-eight patients diagnosed with probable AD. INTERVENTION: Performance of a cognitive task (repeating random digits) while walking. MEASUREMENTS: Neuropsychological measures including clock drawing, verbal fluency, and digit span were obtained along with the Clinical Dementia Rating and Mini-Mental State Examination, the measures of dementia severity. Gait speed and stride-to-stride variability of gait rhythm were measured, once during normal walking and once during dual-task walking. RESULTS: During usual walking, subjects walked slowly and with greater gait variability than older adults without AD. Gait speed was significantly reduced (P<.012) and gait variability increased with dual-task walking (P<.007). The effect on gait variability was larger than the effect on gait speed (P<.015). Executive and neuropsychological function were significantly (P<.02) associated with the increased gait variability that occurred when walking with divided attention but not with gait speed or usual, single-task walking measures of gait. CONCLUSION: Divided attention markedly impairs the ability of patients with AD to regulate the stride-to-stride variations in gait timing. This susceptibility to distraction and its effect on stride time variability, a measure of gait unsteadiness, could partially explain the predilection to falling observed in patients with dementia. The results also support the concept that persons with AD have significant impairments in the cognitive domain of attention and that locomotor function relies upon cognitive, especially executive, function.},

abstract = {Technological advances on the development of mobile devices, medical sensors, and wireless communication systems support a new generation of unobtrusive, portable, and ubiquitous health monitoring systems for continuous patient assessment and more personalized health care. There exist a growing number of mobile apps in the health domain; however, little contribution has been specifically provided, so far, to operate this kind of apps with wearable physiological sensors. The PhysioDroid, presented in this paper, provides a personalized means to remotely monitor and evaluate users’ conditions. The PhysioDroid system provides ubiquitous and continuous vital signs analysis, such as electrocardiogram, heart rate, respiration rate, skin temperature, and body motion, intended to help empower patients and improve clinical understanding. The PhysioDroid is composed of a wearable monitoring device and an Android app providing gathering, storage, and processing features for the physiological sensor data. The versatility of the developed app allows its use for both average users and specialists, and the reduced cost of the PhysioDroid puts it at the reach of most people. Two exemplary use cases for health assessment and sports training are presented to illustrate the capabilities of the PhysioDroid. Next technical steps include generalization to other mobile platforms and health monitoring devices.},

abstract = {BACKGROUND: The estimation of the spatio-temporal gait parameters is of primary importance in both physical activity monitoring and clinical contexts. A method for estimating step length bilaterally, during level walking, using a single inertial measurement unit (IMU) attached to the pelvis is proposed. In contrast to previous studies, based either on a simplified representation of the human gait mechanics or on a general linear regressive model, the proposed method estimates the step length directly from the integration of the acceleration along the direction of progression.$\backslash$n$\backslash$nMETHODS: The IMU was placed at pelvis level fixed to the subject's belt on the right side. The method was validated using measurements from a stereo-photogrammetric system as a gold standard on nine subjects walking ten laps along a closed loop track of about 25 m, varying their speed. For each loop, only the IMU data recorded in a 4 m long portion of the track included in the calibrated volume of the SP system, were used for the analysis. The method takes advantage of the cyclic nature of gait and it requires an accurate determination of the foot contact instances. A combination of a Kalman filter and of an optimally filtered direct and reverse integration applied to the IMU signals formed a single novel method (Kalman and Optimally filtered Step length Estimation - KOSE method). A correction of the IMU displacement due to the pelvic rotation occurring in gait was implemented to estimate the step length and the traversed distance.$\backslash$n$\backslash$nRESULTS: The step length was estimated for all subjects with less than 3{\%} error. Traversed distance was assessed with less than 2{\%} error.$\backslash$n$\backslash$nCONCLUSIONS: The proposed method provided estimates of step length and traversed distance more accurate than any other method applied to measurements obtained from a single IMU that can be found in the literature. In healthy subjects, it is reasonable to expect that, errors in traversed distance estimation during daily monitoring activity would be of the same order of magnitude of those presented.},

In this work we are concerned with the accelerometry-based estimation of the step length in straight line human walking. We compare five step length estimators. Measurements were taken from a group of four adult men, adding up a total of 800 m per individual of walking data. Also modifications to these estimators are proposed, based on biomechanical considerations. Results show that this modifications lead to improvements of interest over previous methods.},

abstract = {The intercycle variability in gait of two temporal parameters (stride time and double-support time) and the step-to-step variability of two spatial parameters (step length and stride width) were assessed in 64 healthy adults, 32 aged 21 to 47 and 32 aged 66 to 84. For all parameters the median values of the coefficient of variation did not differ significantly between the two groups. They were below 6{\%} for step length and stride time but much higher for stride width and double-support time (between 17 and 27{\%}). These differences in variability are discussed in relation to the control systems involved. Step length and stride time are thought to be determined predominantly by the gait-patterning mechanism, whereas stride width and double-support time may be determined predominantly by balance-control mechanisms. The results suggest that, in both age groups, the gait-patterning mechanisms are more consistent in their operation than are the balance-control mechanisms and that increased variability in gait should not be regarded as a normal concomitant of old age.},

abstract = {Smartphones are very common devices in daily life that have a built-in tri-axial accelerometer. Similar to previously developed accelerometers, smartphones can be used to assess gait patterns. However, few gait analyses have been performed using smartphones, and their reliability and validity have not been evaluated yet. The purpose of this study was to evaluate the reliability and validity of a smartphone accelerometer. Thirty healthy young adults participated in this study. They walked 20 m at their preferred speeds, and their trunk accelerations were measured using a smartphone and a tri-axial accelerometer that was secured over the L3 spinous process. We developed a gait analysis application and installed it in the smartphone to measure the acceleration. After signal processing, we calculated the gait parameters of each measurement terminal: peak frequency (PF), root mean square (RMS), autocorrelation peak (AC), and coefficient of variance (CV) of the acceleration peak intervals. Remarkable consistency was observed in the test-retest reliability of all the gait parameter results obtained by the smartphone (p<0.001). All the gait parameter results obtained by the smartphone showed statistically significant and considerable correlations with the same parameter results obtained by the tri-axial accelerometer (PF r=0.99, RMS r=0.89, AC r=0.85, CV r=0.82; p<0.01). Our study indicates that the smartphone with gait analysis application used in this study has the capacity to quantify gait parameters with a degree of accuracy that is comparable to that of the tri-axial accelerometer.},

abstract = {The study of gait variability, the stride-to-stride fluctuations in walking, offers a complementary way of quantifying locomotion and its changes with aging and disease as well as a means of monitoring the effects of therapeutic interventions and rehabilitation. Previous work has suggested that measures of gait variability may be more closely related to falls, a serious consequence of many gait disorders, than are measures based on the mean values of other walking parameters. The Current JNER series presents nine reports on the results of recent investigations into gait variability. One novel method for collecting unconstrained, ambulatory data is reviewed, and a primer on analysis methods is presented along with a heuristic approach to summarizing variability measures. In addition, the first studies of gait variability in animal models of neurodegenerative disease are described, as is a mathematical model of human walking that characterizes certain complex (multifractal) features of the motor control's pattern generator. Another investigation demonstrates that, whereas both healthy older controls and patients with a higher-level gait disorder walk more slowly in reduced lighting, only the latter's stride variability increases. Studies of the effects of dual tasks suggest that the regulation of the stride-to-stride fluctuations in stride width and stride time may be influenced by attention loading and may require cognitive input. Finally, a report of gait variability in over 500 subjects, probably the largest study of this kind, suggests how step width variability may relate to fall risk. Together, these studies provide new insights into the factors that regulate the stride-to-stride fluctuations in walking and pave the way for expanded research into the control of gait and the practical application of measures of gait variability in the clinical setting.},

abstract = {BACKGROUND: Many techniques that compensate for locomotion problems in daily life using externally controlled stimulation have recently been reported. These techniques are beneficial for effortlessly supporting patients' locomotive functions, but the users of such devices must necessarily remain dependent on them. It is possible that some individuals with gait impairment may be prevented recovering locomotive function. From a rehabilitation viewpoint, it may therefore be supposed that ideally, devices that can be used in daily life to improve the locomotive functions of the body itself should be proposed.$\backslash$n$\backslash$nMETHODS: We evaluate the effectiveness of Walk-Mate, which has been used mainly as a gait compensation device, as a gait rehabilitation training device by analyzing improvement in locomotion before, during and after rehabilitation in hemiparetic patients and comparing it with a previous gait training method. Walk-Mate generates a model walking rhythm in response to a user's locomotion in real time, and by indicating this rhythm using auditory stimuli, provides a technology that supports walking by reducing asymmetries and fluctuations in foot contact rhythm. If patients can use the system to learn a regulated walking rhythm, then it may also be expected to fulfil the functions of a gait rehabilitation training device for daily life.$\backslash$n$\backslash$nRESULTS: With regard to asymmetry, significantly improvements were seen for compensatory movement during training using Walk-Mate, but improvements were not retained as rehabilitative results. Regarding fluctuations in the foot contact period, significant improvement was observed for compensatory movement during training and these significant improvements were retained as rehabilitative results. In addition, it became clear that such improvement could not be adequately obtained by the previously proposed training technique utilizing constant rhythmic auditory stimulation.$\backslash$n$\backslash$nCONCLUSIONS: Walk-Mate effectively compensated for locomotion problems of hemiparetic patients by improving gait rhythm both during and after training, suggesting that locomotive function can be effectively recovered in some patients. The interactive mechanism of Walk-Mate may be capable of simultaneously achieving the aims of gait compensation and gait rehabilitation training methods previously developed under individual frameworks. Walk-Mate is a promising technology for assisting the reintegration of disabled persons into society.},

abstract = {Purpose: To compare the stride-to-stride fluctuations, regularity and symmetry of gait using a body-fixed accelerometer in a group of healthy young and healthy older adults. Methods: Forty-one healthy young adults (24 ± 3 years) and forty-one healthy older adults (76 ± 5 years) completed a 10-min walk at a self-selected, normal walking speed while wearing a single waist-mounted tri-axial accelerometer. The following gait parameters were compared between age groups: mean step and stride time, step and stride time variability, stride time fractal scaling index and the regularity and symmetry of the acceleration pattern in the vertical, mediolateral and anteroposterior directions (unbiased autocorrelation procedure). Results: Older adults displayed significantly greater step and stride time variability (p< 0.05) and a lower stride time fractal scaling index (p< 0.01), as well as significantly less regularity (p< 0.05) and symmetry (p< 0.05) of the anteroposterior accelerations. Conclusion: The results show that healthy older adults possess greater temporal gait variability, as well as a less-organized and repeatable pattern of variability and acceleration in the direction of motion, than younger adults. The findings also suggest the presence of an age-related decline in the anteroposterior control of gait, but not in the vertical and mediolateral control of gait. © 2013 Elsevier B.V.},

Eight healthy subjects walked on a treadmill using 25 different FL combinations (0.95<L<1.5 m, and 0.8<F<1.26 Hz). The results showed that spatial and temporal variabilities tend to increase in concert with respect to change in stride parameters. In addition, stride variability was found (1) to be minimal at F=1 Hz; and (2) to increase with smaller L. During additional trials, subjects walked freely at various speeds. Although it is generally hypothesized that freely chosen behaviors are optimal in terms of variability, our data show that this is not always the case in human gait.},

abstract = {Freezing of gait (FOG) is a disabling phenomenon common in patients with advanced Parkinson's disease (PD). The cause of FOG is unclear. The objective of this study was to explore a novel hypothesis stating that FOG is related to asymmetric motor performance. We compared PD patients that experience FOG episodes (PD+FOG) with PD patients that do not (PD-FOG) and studied the relationship of FOG to asymmetry in gait and in rhythmic hand movement performance to determine whether potential FOG-related gait asymmetry is unique to walking or whether it is systemic. Subjects were tested in an "off" (unmedicated) and again in an "on" (medicated) state. Gait was more asymmetric in PD+FOG than in PD-FOG during "off" state (p = 0.005) and during "on" (p = 0.016). Rhythmicity of foot swing in one leg was correlated with the other leg in PD-FOG but not in PD+FOG. There was no difference in asymmetry in performance of rhythmic hand movements between the two groups. No correlation was found between asymmetry of clinical symptoms and gait asymmetry. Taken together, the results of this study suggest that bilateral uncoordinated gait and marked gait asymmetry, but not asymmetry in motor performance in general, are associated with FOG.},

abstract = {BACKGROUND: Cognition and mobility in older adults are closely associated and they decline together with aging. Studies evaluating associations between cognitive factors and gait performance in people with Mild Cognitive Impairment (MCI) are scarce. In this study, our aim was to determine whether specific cognitive factors have a more identifiable effect on gait velocity during dual-tasking in people with MCI.

METHODS: Fifty-five participants, mean age 77.7 (SD = 5.9), 45{\%} women, with MCI were evaluated for global cognition, working memory, executive function, and attention. Gait Velocity (GV) was measured under a single-task condition (single GV) and under two dual-task conditions: 1) while counting backwards (counting GV), 2) while naming animals (verbal GV). Multivariable linear regression analysis was used to examine associations with an alpha-level of 0.05.

RESULTS: Participants experienced a reduction in GV while engaging in dual-task challenges (p < 0.005). Low executive function and working memory performances were associated with slow single GV (p = 0.038), slow counting GV (p = 0.017), and slow verbal GV (p = 0.031). After adjustments, working memory was the only cognitive factor which remained significantly associated with a slow GV.

CONCLUSION: In older adults with MCI, low working memory performance was associated with slow GV. Dual-task conditions showed the strongest associations with gait slowing. Our findings suggest that cortical control of gait is associated with decline in working memory in people with MCI.},

abstract = {This thesis examined post-stroke gait asymmetry: a prevalent issue and one that has a number of associated negative consequences (e.g. challenged balance control, gait inefficiencies, increased risk of musculoskeletal injury to the non-paretic limb and decreased overall activity levels). This thesis is comprised of three studies that focused on 1) how gait symmetry should be measured, 2) how gait asymmetry may change in the long term post-stroke and 3) whether gait asymmetry is responsive to a rehabilitation intervention. A comparison of the most common expressions of spatiotemporal gait symmetry revealed that the simple symmetry ratio calculation was most appropriate on the basis of ease of interpretation and clinical usefulness. Swing time, stance time and step length were found to be the most useful gait parameters to assess for symmetry. Although related, swing time, stance time and step length ratios exhibit variation in the discrimination of post-stroke individuals, in their inter-relationships and in their relationship velocity. When when used together, swing time, stance time and step length asymmetry ratios may provide a complementary picture of the gait pattern and the quality of gait control. It was also demonstrated that swing time and stance time asymmetry were worse in later stages post-stroke when assessed cross-sectionally. In contrast, gait velocity did not exhibit this pattern. These results indicate that the control of gait (symmetry) may decline over time post-stroke, independent from the capacity for gait which remains constant (velocity). This dissociation in characteristics supports the concept that these two variables (symmetry and velocity) may represent separate features of post-stroke gait. Finally, individuals with sub-acute stroke are capable of altering the temporal symmetry of their gait in response to visual biofeedback. Individuals with sub- acute stroke differ in terms of the strategy they employ in response to biofeedback and the observed improvements in gait symmetry were not always achieved in the desired manner: increased use of the paretic lower extremity. This thesis presents new information regarding the asymmetrical nature of post-stroke gait. Future work may extend these findings to develop a comprehensive approach to gait measurement as well as gait interventions that encourage increased paretic limb use instead of compensatory behaviour. iii},

abstract = {Objectives: The recovery of independent walking is an important goal in stroke rehabilitation. The objective of this systematic review was to identify all outcome measures used in the stroke research literature that included an evaluation of walking ability and evaluate the concepts contained in these measures with reference to the International Classification of Functioning, Disability and Health (ICF) framework. Data sources: Searches were conducted of MEDLINE, CINAHL, EMBASE and PsycINFO databases for the time period January 1990-December 2005 using appropriate keywords. Review methods: Studies were selected for further analysis if they used one or more standardized outcome measure incorporating an aspect of walking defined by the ICF. The outcome measure had to have published psychometric properties and specifically measure walking rather than mobility. The content of each outcome measure was classified with reference to the ICF subcategories for walking. The number of times each outcome measure was used was calculated. Results: Three hundred and fifty-seven studies met the selection criteria. Sixty-one different outcome measures were used a total of 848 times to measure walking ability. Six of the outcome measures reflected impairment and 52 reflected limitations of activity and participation. The other three outcome measures showed overlap between domains, reflecting aspects of both impairment and limitations in activity and participation. The three most frequently used measures (self-paced gait speed measured over a short distance, spatiotemporal parameters and fast gait speed) were used 350 times but only assessed one ICF subcategory. The Rivermead Mobility Index and the Adapted Patient Evaluation Conference System assessed the greatest number of ICF subcategories but were used only 19 times and once respectively. Conclusions: The most frequently used outcome measures reflect only one aspect of walking ability: walking short distances. Mobility tasks related to function in the community, like walking long distances, around obstacles and over uneven ground, and moving around outside or in buildings other then the home are not well represented by outcome measures used in most studies. ?? 2007 Chartered Society of Physiotherapy.},

A new gait analysis system is proposed which consists of (a) an ambulatory device (Physilog®) including a set of miniature gyroscopes and a portable datalogger, and (b) an algorithm for gait analysis. The aim of this study was the validation of this system, for accuracy and clinical applicability. Eleven patients with coxarthrosis, eight patients with total hip arthroplasty and nine control subjects were studied using this portable system and also a reference motion analyzer and force plate. The small differences in the stance period (19±31 ms), stride length and velocity (0.4±9.6 cm and 2.5±8.3 cm/s, respectively), as well as thigh and shank rotations (2.4±4.3° and 0.3±3.3°, respectively), confirmed good agreement of the proposed system with the reference system. In addition, nearly the same accuracy was obtained for all three groups. Gait analysis based on Physilog® was also in agreement with their Harris Hip Scores (HHS): the subjects with lower scores had a greater limp, a slower walking speed and a shorter stride.

Wearing shoes with ink-applied felt squares attached to the heels, healthy students walked on a flat walkway (0.6 x 16 m) at five different speeds with a freely chosen step rate in experiment 1 and walked at three different speeds with five different step rates in experiment 2. Free walk was found to have the fewest variable errors (VEs) in step length approximately at preferred walking speed. Variable error in step width increased linearly with an increase in walking speed. Under imposed step rates, VEs in step length were the fewest when walking with step rates close to those in free walk. Our everyday walking is performed most frequently at preferred speed and/or with freely chosen step rate, thereby optimizing the consistency of gait performance. Intrasubject variability in step length may be a useful measure for evaluation of walking.},

abstract = {Alzheimer's disease (AD) is generally understood as primarily affecting cognition while sparing motor function, at least until the later stages of the disease. Studies reported over the past 10 years, however, have documented a prevalence of falls in AD patients significantly higher than in age-matched normal elders; also persons with AD have been observed to have different walking patterns with characteristics that increase gait instability. Recent work in cognitive neuroscience has begun to demonstrate the necessity of intact cognition, particularly executive function, for competent motor control. We put the pieces of this puzzle together and review the current state of knowledge about gait and cognition in general along with an exploration of the association between dementia, gait impairment and falls in AD. We also briefly examine the current treatment of gait instability in AD, mainly exercise, and propose a new approach targeting cognition.},

abstract = {A general-purpose system to obtain the kinematics of gait in the sagittal plane based on body-mounted sensors was developed. It consisted of four uniaxial seismic accelerometers and one rate gyroscope per body segment. Tests were done with 10 young healthy volunteers, walking at five different speeds on a treadmill. In order to study the system's accuracy, measurements were made with an optic, passive-marker system and the body-mounted system, simultaneously. In all the comparison cases, the curves obtained from the two systems were very close, showing root mean square errors representing <7{\%} full range in 75{\%} of the cases (overall mean 6.64{\%}, standard deviation 4.13{\%}) and high coefficients of multiple correlation in 100{\%} of cases (overall mean 0.9812, standard deviation 0.02). Calibration of the body-mounted system is done against gravity. The body-mounted sensors do not hinder natural movement. The calculation algorithms are computationally demanding and only are applicable off-line. The body-mounted sensors are accurate, inexpensive and portable and allow long-term recordings in clinical, sport and ergonomics settings. ?? 2002 Elsevier Science Ltd. All rights reserved.},

abstract = {In this paper a novel step length model using a handheld Micro Electrical Mechanical System (MEMS) is presented. It combines the user's step frequency and height with a set of three parameters for estimating step length. The model has been developed and trained using 12 different subjects: six men and six women. For reliable estimation of the step frequency with a handheld device, the frequency content of the handheld sensor's signal is extracted by applying the Short Time Fourier Transform (STFT) independently from the step detection process. The relationship between step and hand frequencies is analyzed for different hand's motions and sensor carrying modes. For this purpose, the frequency content of synchronized signals collected with two sensors placed in the hand and on the foot of a pedestrian has been extracted. Performance of the proposed step length model is assessed with several field tests involving 10 test subjects different from the above 12. The percentages of error over the travelled distance using universal parameters and a set of parameters calibrated for each subject are compared. The fitted solutions show an error between 2.5 and 5{\%} of the travelled distance, which is comparable with that achieved by models proposed in the literature for body fixed sensors only.},

@article{Ancoli-Israel2003,
abstract = {In summary, although actigraphy is not as accurate as PSG for determining some sleep measurements, studies are in general agreement that actigraphy, with its ability to record continuously for long time periods, is more reliable than sleep logs which rely on the patients' recall of how many times they woke up or how long they slept during the night and is more reliable than observations which only capture short time periods. Actigraphy can provide information obtainable in no other practical way. It can also have a role in the medical care of patients with sleep disorders. However, it should not be held to the same expectations as polysomnography. Actigraphy is one-dimensional, whereas polysomnography comprises at least 3 distinct types of data (EEG, EOG, EMG), which jointly determine whether a person is asleep or awake. It is therefore doubtful whether actigraphic data will ever be informationally equivalent to the PSG, although progress on hardware and data processing software is continuously being made. Although the 1995 practice parameters paper determined that actigraphy was not appropriate for the diagnosis of sleep disorders, more recent studies suggest that for some disorders, actigraphy may be more practical than PSG. While actigraphy is still not appropriate for the diagnosis of sleep disordered breathing or of periodic limb movements in sleep, it is highly appropriate for examining the sleep variability (i.e., night-to-night variability) in patients with insomnia. Actigraphy is also appropriate for the assessment of and stability of treatment effects of anything from hypnotic drugs to light treatment to CPAP, particularly if assessments are done before and after the start of treatment. A recent independent review of the actigraphy literature by Sadeh and Acebo reached many of these same conclusions. Some of the research studies failed to find relationships between sleep measures and health-related symptoms. The interpretation of these data is also not clear-cut. Is it that the actigraph is not reliable enough to the access the relationship between sleep changes and quality of life measures, or, is it that, in fact, there is no relationship between sleep in that population and quality of life measures? Other studies of sleep disordered breathing, where actigraphy was not used and was not an outcome measure also failed to find any relationship with quality of life. Is it then the actigraph that is not reliable or that the associations just do not exist? The one area where actigraphy can be used for clinical diagnosis is in the evaluation of circadian rhythm disorders. Actigraphy has been shown to be very good for identifying rhythms. Results of actigraphic recordings correlate well with measurements of melatonin and of core body temperature rhythms. Activity records also show sleep disturbance when sleep is attempted at an unfavorable phase of the circadian cycle. Actigraphy therefore would be particularly good for aiding in the diagnosis of delayed or advanced sleep phase syndrome, non-24-hour-sleep syndrome and in the evaluation of sleep disturbances in shift workers. It must be remembered, however, that overt rest-activity rhythms are susceptible to various masking effects, so they may not always show the underlying rhythm of the endogenous circadian pacemaker. In conclusion, the latest set of research articles suggest that in the clinical setting, actigraphy is reliable for evaluating sleep patterns in patients with insomnia, for studying the effect of treatments designed to improve sleep, in the diagnosis of circadian rhythm disorders (including shift work), and in evaluating sleep in individuals who are less likely to tolerate PSG, such as infants and demented elderly. While actigraphy has been used in research studies for many years, up to now, methodological issues had not been systematically addressed in clinical research and practice. Those issues have now been addressed and actigraphy may now be reaching the maturity needed for application in the clinical arena.},

Increasing evidence, however, links alterations in executive function and attention to gait disturbances. This review discusses the role of executive function and attention in healthy walking and gait disorders while summarizing the relevant, recent literature. We describe the variety of gait disorders that may be associated with different aspects of executive function, and discuss the changes occurring in executive function as a result of aging and disease as well the potential impact of these changes on gait. The attentional demands of gait are often tested using dual tasking methodologies. Relevant studies in healthy adults and patients are presented, as are the possible mechanisms responsible for the deterioration of gait during dual tasking. Lastly, we suggest how assessments of executive function and attention could be applied in the clinical setting as part of the process of identifying and understanding gait disorders and fall risk.},

abstract = {Background and Purpose. The interpretation of patient scores on clinical tests of physical mobility is limited by a lack of data describing the range of performance among people without disabilities. The purpose of this study was to provide data for 4 common clinical tests in a sample of community-dwelling older adults. Subjects. Ninety-six community-dwelling elderly people (61-89 years of age) with independent functioning performed 4 clinical tests. Methods. Data were collected on the Six-Minute Walk Test (6MW), Berg Balance Scale (BBS), and Timed Up {\&} Go Test (TUG) and during comfortable- and fast-speed walking (CGS and FGS). Intraclass correlation coefficients (ICCs) were used to determine the test-retest reliability for the 6MW, TUG, CGS, and FGS measurements. Data were analyzed by gender and age (60-69, 70-79, and 80-89 years) cohorts, similar to previous studies. Means, standard deviations, and 95{\%} confidence intervals for each measurement were calculated for each cohort. Results. The 6MW, TUG, CGS, and FGS measurements showed high test-retest reliability (ICC [2,1]=.95-.97). Mean test scores showed a trend of age-related declines for the 6MW, BBS, TUG, CGS, and FGS for both male and female subjects. Discussion and Conclusion. Preliminary descriptive data suggest that physical therapists should use age-related data when interpreting patient data obtained for the 6MW, BBS, TUG, CGS and FGS. Further data on these clinical tests with larger sample sizes are needed to serve as a reference for patient comparisons.

abstract = {This paper studies the feasibility of an analysis of spatio-temporal gait parameters based upon accelerometry. To this purpose, acceleration patterns of the trunk and their relationships with spatio-temporal gait parameters were analysed in healthy subjects. Based on model predictions of the body's centre of mass trajectory during walking, algorithms were developed to determine spatio-temporal gait parameters from trunk acceleration data. In a first experiment, predicted gait parameters were compared with gait parameters determined from ground reaction forces measured by a treadmill. In a second experiment, spatio-temporal gait parameters were determined during overground walking. From the results of these experiments, it is concluded that, in healthy subjects, the duration of subsequent stride cycles and left/right steps, and estimations of step length and walking speed can be obtained from lower trunk accelerations. The possibility to identify subsequent stride cycles can be the basis for an analysis of other signals (e.g. kinematic or muscle activity) within the stride cycle. © 2002 Elsevier Science B.V.

abstract = {Gait analysis has radically changed the treatment of cerebral palsy. Preoperatively, it allows critical assessment of the specific pathologies of the patient. Postoperatively, it provides an accurate assessment of outcome. This assessment of outcome has in turn allowed the accurate critique of surgeries and has made it possible to discard treatments that are not useful or are perhaps even injurious. As a result of this continual reassessment of surgical techniques, several principles and insights regarding the treatment of cerebral palsy have been learned. These include (1) the importance of reestablishing normal gait prerequisites, (2) the methods of reducing the energy expenditure of the pathologic gait, (3) the importance of skeletal structures in providing the lever arm by which muscles produce moments around joints, (4) the role and importance of two joint muscles, and (5) the importance of separating abnormalities, which are emanating from the neurologic lesion, from secondary ("coping") responses. Through gait analysis, it has become apparent that diplegia and hemiplegia are noninclusive terms, each of which contain a variety of homogeneous patterns of gait. Eventually these patterns may be separated and identified and optimal treatment protocols for each pattern type developed.},

abstract = {It had long been known that the decapitated cock can cross a yard. During the last century an automatic mechanism controlling stepping movements has also been found in other vertebrates. The system controlling locomotion has many features similar to these systems controlling other natural movements: respiration (28), micturition (98), scratching (154), mastication (33), etc. Today we know that there are spinal automatisms for each limb generating its stepping movements. Activity of these automatisms depends essentially on the afferent inflow from the moving limbs. There also is interaction of the limbs during locomotion that promotes their coordination. The existence of two descending systems with different functions in the control of locomotion (Fig. 1) also can be considered as an established fact. Activity of a number of neurons involved in the control of locomotion has been studied directly during locomotion in decorticate, thalamic, and mesencephalic cats. To explain the experimental data at hand, several hypotheses of organization of the spinal automatism of stepping have been forwarded: a chain-reflex hypothesis, a hypothesis of two reciprocal half-centers, and a ring hypothesis (Fig. 2). Although general features of the system controlling locomotion are more or less clear, many questions are not yet answered. It is unknown what relative contributions to motoneuronal activity are made by proprioceptive reflexes versus influences from the automatism of stepping. Furthermore the structure of the spinal stepping automatism is not known. It is not clear if the spinal stepping automatisms of the forelimbs are as potent as those of the hindlimbs. The descending system responsible for activation of the spinal automatism of stepping has not yet been identified in direct experiments. The inputs and outputs of the subthalamic and midbrain "locomotor" regions have not been found, and we know almost nothing about intrinsic interaction of neurons in these regions. The role of inhibitory thalamic influences is scarcely known. Finally, we have no data concerning the influence of either cortical (42, 186) or visual mechanisms in locomotor control.},

abstract = {Development of denoising algorithm for 3D acceleration signals is essential to facilitate accurate assessment of human movement in body sensor networks (BSN). In this study, firstly 3D acceleration signals were captured by self-developed nine-axis wireless BSN platform during 12 subjects performing regular walking. Then, acceleration noise was filtered using four common filters respectively: median filter, Butterworth low-pass filter, discrete wavelet package shrinkage and Kalman filter. Finally, signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) and correlation coefficient(R) between filtered signal and reference signal were determined. We found that (1) Kalman filter showed the largest SNR and R values, followed by median filter, discrete wavelet package shrinkage and finally Butterworth low-pass filter; whereas, after correcting waveform delay for Butterworth low-pass filter, its performance was a little better than that of Kalman filter; (2) Real-time performance of median filter related to its window length; Decomposition level influenced real-time performance of discrete wavelet package shrinkage; Butterworth low-pass filter could bring large waveform delay if filter order and cut-off frequency were not properly selected. The algorithms of these filters would be further investigated to achieve best noise reduction of 3D acceleration signals in future.},

abstract = {The reliability of accelerometry for measuring sedentary behavior in preschoolers has not been determined, thus we determined how many days of accelerometry monitoring are necessary to reliably estimate daily time spent in sedentary behavior in preschoolers. In total, 191 and 150 preschoolers (three to five years) wore ActiGraph accelerometers (15-s epoch) during the in-school (≥4 days) and the total-day (≥6 days) period respectively. Accelerometry data were summarized as time spent in sedentary behavior (min/h) using three different cutpoints developed for preschool-age children (<37.5, <200, and <373 counts/15 s). The intraclass correlations (ICCs) and Spearman-Brown prophecy formula were used to estimate the reliability of accelerometer for measuring sedentary behavior. Across different cutpoints, the ICCs ranged from 0.81 to 0.92 for in-school sedentary behavior, and from 0.75 to 0.81 for total-day sedentary behavior, respectively. To achieve an ICC of ≥0.8, two to four days or six to nine days of monitoring were needed for in-school sedentary behavior and total-day sedentary behavior, respectively. These findings provide important guidance for future research on sedentary behavior in preschool children using accelerometry. Understanding the reliability of accelerometry will facilitate the conduct of research designed to inform policies and practices aimed at reducing sedentary behavior in preschool children.},

abstract = {The ubiquity of communication devices such as smartphones has led to the emergence of context-aware services that are able to respond to specific user activities or contexts. These services allow communication providers to develop new, added-value services for a wide range of applications such as social networking, elderly care and near-emergency early warning systems. At the core of these services is the ability to detect specific physical settings or the context a user is in, using either internal or external sensors. For example, using built-in accelerometers, it is possible to determine whether a user is walking or running at a specific time of day. By correlating this knowledge with GPS data, it is possible to provide specific information services to users with similar daily routines. This article presents a survey of the techniques for extracting this activity information from raw accelerometer data. The techniques that can be implemented in mobile devices range from classical signal processing techniques such as FFT to contemporary string-based methods. We present experimental results to compare and evaluate the accuracy of the various techniques using real data sets collected from daily activities.},

@article{Spasic2015,
abstract = {BACKGROUND: Standard care for the rehabilitation of knee conditions involves exercise programs and information provision. Current methods of rehabilitation delivery struggle to keep up with large volumes of patients and the length of treatment required to maximize the recovery. Therefore, the development of novel interventions to support self-management is strongly recommended. Such interventions need to include information provision, goal setting, monitoring, feedback, and support groups, but the most effective methods of their delivery are poorly understood. The Internet provides a medium for intervention delivery with considerable potential for meeting these needs.

OBJECTIVE: The objective of this study was to demonstrate the feasibility of a Web-based app and to conduct a preliminary review of its practicability as part of a complex medical intervention in the rehabilitation of knee disorders. This paper describes the development, implementation, and usability of such an app.

METHODS: An interdisciplinary team of health care professionals and researchers, computer scientists, and app developers developed the TRAK app suite. The key functionality of the app includes information provision, a three-step exercise program based on a standard care for the rehabilitation of knee conditions, self-monitoring with visual feedback, and a virtual support group. There were two types of stakeholders (patients and physiotherapists) that were recruited for the usability study. The usability questionnaire was used to collect both qualitative and quantitative information on computer and Internet usage, task completion, and subjective user preferences.

RESULTS: A total of 16 patients and 15 physiotherapists participated in the usability study. Based on the System Usability Scale, the TRAK app has higher perceived usability than 70{\%} of systems. Both patients and physiotherapists agreed that the given Web-based approach would facilitate communication, provide information, help recall information, improve understanding, enable exercise progression, and support self-management in general. The Web app was found to be easy to use and user satisfaction was very high. The TRAK app suite can be accessed at http://apps.facebook.com/kneetrak/.

CONCLUSIONS: The usability study suggests that a Web-based intervention is feasible and acceptable in supporting self-management of knee conditions.},

abstract = {BACKGROUND: The relationship between frailty and gait characteristics other than velocity has received little attention. Gait variability quantifies the automaticity of gait with greater variability usually indicating an irregular and unstable gait. High gait variability reflects the loss of gait regulation and predicts mobility decline and falls, which may reveal systemic vulnerability. Thus, we hypothesize that high gait variability may be associated with frailty phenotype.

METHODS: Cross-sectional study including 100 community-dwelling women and men 75 years and older. Frailty was defined using validated phenotypic criteria and two additional frailty indexes that omit gait velocity criterion were used to verify associations between frailty and quantitative gait parameters. Gait was assessed under usual and fast pace using an electronic walkway.

RESULTS: Frailty phenotype was identified in 20{\%} of the participants and at least one component of frailty was present in 75{\%}. Linear regression models were generated to explore the associations between frailty and gait variability. In the univariate regression model, frailty was associated with higher variability for all the gait parameters of interest. After adjustments, stride time variability under fast gait condition was the most prominent parameter consistently associated with frailty. This association remained significant in two additional frailty indexes that omit gait velocity criterion.

CONCLUSION: Frailty is associated with low performance in several quantitative gait parameters beyond velocity of which the most prominent is high stride time variability. This finding may help to understand the high risk of falls and mobility decline in people with frailty.},

abstract = {This article will review those electrophysiological investigations which have addressed the neuronal mechanisms underlying impaired gait. The aims of the review are to provide further insights to the underlying pathophysiology of impaired gait and also towards the selection of an appropriate treatment. From the patients' point of view the first indication of a central motor system lesion is an impairment of movement, most notably locomotion. These symptoms are characteristic in cases of spasticity, cerebellar lesion or Parkinson's disease. Clinical examination reveals typical changes in tendon tap reflexes and muscle tone which were believed to account for the movement disorder presented. However, we now know that there is only a weak relationship between the physical symptoms observed daring clinical examination under passive motor conditions and the altered neuronal mechanisms underlying the impairment during active motion. By recording and analysing electrophysiological and biomechanical parameters during functional movements such as locomotion, the significance of impaired reflex behaviour or the pathophysiology of muscle tone and its contribution to the movement disorder can be reliably assessed. Consequently, the treatment should not be cosmetic, i.e. the correction of an isolated clinical parameter, but should be based on the pathophysiology and significance of those mechanisms underlying the impairment of the patients' movements. Data from electro- physiological and biomechanical investigations of locomotion of patients with spasticity, cerebellar disorder or Parkinson's disease are discussed in this review. The neuronal mechanisms, which are essentially central programs and afferent input, involved in disorders of gait are evaluated on the basis of their function in healthy subjects. The impact of this analysis in deciding an appropriate treatment are discussed with respect to the pathophysiology underlying the gait disorder (spasticity, cerebellar disorder or Parkinson's disease). At the present time we have only a basic understanding of the essential receptor systems, such as leg extensor load receptors, and their interaction with other systems involved in postural control. In the future, the knowledge gained from gait analysis may help in the selection of the appropriate pharmacological and physical treatment required even though the patient may only be at an early stage of motor impairment.},

Accurate determination of the Initial Contact of the foot with the floor (IC) and the final contact or Foot Off (FO) on different terrains is important. This paper describes the evaluation of a gyroscope placed on the shank for determination of IC and FO in subjects walking outdoors on level ground, and up and down an incline. Performance was compared with a reference pressure measurement system. The mean difference between the gyroscope and the reference was less than -25 ms for IC and less than 75 ms for FO for all terrains. Detection success was over 98{\%}. These results provide preliminary evidence supporting the use of the gyroscope for gait event detection on inclines as well as level walking.},

The method we used to develop our task-fit taxonomy followed an iterative approach that considered over 100 well-known examples crowdsourcing. Our taxonomy considers three dimensions of task complexity: (1) task structure--is the task well-defined, or does it require a more open-ended solution; (2) task interdependence--can the task be solved by an individual or does it require a community of problem solvers; and (3) task commitment—what level of commitment is expected from crowd members? Based on our taxonomy, we identify seven categories of crowdsourcing, and discuss prototypical examples of each approach. Furnished with such an understanding, one should be able to determine which crowdsourcing approach is most suitable for a particular task situation.},

abstract = {BACKGROUND: Accelerometer-based activity monitors are widely used in research and surveillance applications for quantifying sedentary behavior (SB) and physical activity (PA). Considerable research has been done to refine methods for assessing PA, but relatively little attention has been given to operationalizing SB parameters (i.e., sedentary time and breaks) from accelerometer data - particularly in relation to health outcomes. This study investigated: (a) the accrued patterns of sedentary time and breaks; and (b) the associations of sedentary time and breaks in different bout durations with cardiovascular risk factors.$\backslash$n$\backslash$nMETHODS: Accelerometer data on 5,917 adults from the National Health Examination and Nutrition Survey (NHANES) 2003-2006 were used. Sedentary time and breaks at different bout durations (i.e., 1, 2-4, 5-9, 10-14, 15-19, 20-24, 25-29, and ≥ 30-min) were obtained using a threshold of < 100 counts per minute. Sedentary time and breaks were regressed on cardiovascular risk factors (waist circumference, triglyceride, and high-density lipoprotein cholesterol) and body mass index across bout durations.$\backslash$n$\backslash$nRESULTS: The results revealed that the majority of sedentary time occurred within relatively short bout durations (≈ 70{\%} and ≈ 85{\%} for < 5-min and < 10-min, respectively). The associations of sedentary time and breaks with health outcomes varied depending on how bout time was defined. Estimates of SB parameters based on bout durations of 5 min or shorter were associated with reduced cardiovascular risk factors while durations longer than 10-min were generally associated with increased risk factors.$\backslash$n$\backslash$nCONCLUSIONS: The present study demonstrates that the duration of sedentary bouts should be further considered when operationalizing the SB parameters from accelerometer data. The threshold of 5 minutes to define a bout is defensible, but a 10 minute threshold would provide a more conservative estimate to clearly capture the prolonged nature of sedentary behavior. Additional research is needed to determine the relative sensitivity and specificity of these thresholds.},

abstract = {OBJECTIVE: We compared falling and non-falling healthy elderly subjects to identify balance disorders associated with falling. Gait parameters were determined when carrying out single and dual tasks. DESIGN: Case comparison study. SETTING: Subjects were studied in the gait laboratory at H{\^{o}}pital Roger Salengro, Lille, France. SUBJECTS: A group of 40 healthy elderly women were assigned to one of two groups according to their falling history: 21 fallers aged 70.4 +/- 6.4 years and 19 non-fallers aged 67.0 +/- 4.8 years. All subjects performed first a single leg balance test with two conditions (eyes open/closed). Then, gait parameters were analysed under single-task and dual motor-task conditions (walking with a glass of water in the hand). MAIN MEASURES: Falls, number of times suspended foot touched the floor during the single leg balance test, cadence, speed, stride time, step time, single-support time, stride length and step length during walking under single- and dual-task conditions. RESULTS: During the single leg balance test, fallers placed their feet on the floor three times more often than non-fallers under eyes open conditions (P < 0.05) and twice as often under eyes closed conditions (P < 0.05). In the single-task condition, no significant difference in gait parameters was reported between fallers and non-fallers. There was a significant difference (P < 0.05) in the gait parameters (cadence, speed, stride and step time, single-support time) between fallers and non-fallers under dual-task conditions. CONCLUSIONS: Dual tasks perturb walking in fallers, who exhibit deteriorated static balance. Consequently, walking under dual-task conditions plus a single leg balance test could be helpful in detecting walking disorders and planning physiotherapy to prevent falls.},

While each has its own distinguishing features and by definition all impact upon day to day functioning, no random community derived sample has examined clinical features as defined by gait and balance abnormalities and compared disability ratings of the three dementias simultaneously. Six hundred and forty-seven community dwelling subjects participated in the Sydney Older Persons Study and of these 537 participated in a medical assessment. Of these 537,482 informants rated disability. Gait and balance abnormalities of the three major dementias were identified and the association of the dementias with disability examined. The three major dementias showed evidence of both slowing and ataxia in gait and balance tests. This was maximal in those with PDD. Similarly, all showed evidence of disability that was maximal in those with PDD. In conclusion, this study has identified that gait abnormalities are present in all three dementias to a varying degree. It is hypothesised that the varying levels of disability observed are a consequence of the varying levels of motor impairment, resulting in greater levels of disability in those with PDD.},

abstract = {The study of gait variability, the stride-to-stride fluctuations in walking, offers a complementary way of quantifying locomotion and its changes with aging and disease as well as a means of monitoring the effects of therapeutic interventions and rehabilitation. Previous work has suggested that measures of gait variability may be more closely related to falls, a serious consequence of many gait disorders, than are measures based on the mean values of other walking parameters. The Current JNER series presents nine reports on the results of recent investigations into gait variability. One novel method for collecting unconstrained, ambulatory data is reviewed, and a primer on analysis methods is presented along with a heuristic approach to summarizing variability measures. In addition, the first studies of gait variability in animal models of neurodegenerative disease are described, as is a mathematical model of human walking that characterizes certain complex (multifractal) features of the motor control's pattern generator. Another investigation demonstrates that, whereas both healthy older controls and patients with a higher-level gait disorder walk more slowly in reduced lighting, only the latter's stride variability increases. Studies of the effects of dual tasks suggest that the regulation of the stride-to-stride fluctuations in stride width and stride time may be influenced by attention loading and may require cognitive input. Finally, a report of gait variability in over 500 subjects, probably the largest study of this kind, suggests how step width variability may relate to fall risk. Together, these studies provide new insights into the factors that regulate the stride-to-stride fluctuations in walking and pave the way for expanded research into the control of gait and the practical application of measures of gait variability in the clinical setting.},

Cognitive tests, particularly those assessing verbal recall, have been found to be useful in the identification of elderly people with MCI. We argue that a variety of motor/psychomotor evaluations are also sensitive to MCI. Motor assessments described as complex correctly categorize normal versus MCI elderly with comparable accuracies to those obtained by cognitive tests. Unlike performance on verbally based cognitive measures, motor-test scores appear to be relatively independent of educational attainment, indicating that the use of certain motor tests may be particularly valuable in the identification of MCI among elderly with widely varying educational backgrounds.},

abstract = {Attention plays an important role in the gait disturbances of patients with Parkinson's disease (PD); however, the effects of "dual tasking" on fall risk and gait instability have not been well studied. The authors tested the hypothesis that gait variability increases when subjects with PD walk while performing a cognitively challenging task (CCT). Subjects with idiopathic PD walked under normal conditions and while performing a CCT. During normal walking, gait variability was significantly (.0001 < P < .05) correlated with fall risk, disease duration, disease severity, motor function, mentation, behavior and mood, and cognitive function. When walking while cognitively challenged, gait variability increased (from 47 29 msec to 223 281 msec, P < .002). During dual-task walking, only disease duration remained significantly associated with gait variability. These results highlight the profound effects of attention on gait and indicate that walking while cognitively challenged impairs the ability of patients with PD to maintain a stable walk.},

@article{RomanD.;Villaverde2014,
abstract = {Mycotoxins are small (MW approximately 700), toxic chemical products formed as secondary metabolites by a few fungal species that readily colonise crops and contaminate them with toxins in the field or after harvest. Ochratoxins and Aflatoxins are mycotoxins of major significance and hence there has been significant research on broad range of analytical and detection techniques that could be useful and practical. Due to the variety of structures of these toxins, it is impossible to use one standard technique for analysis and/or detection. Practical requirements for high-sensitivity analysis and the need for a specialist laboratory setting create challenges for routine analysis. Several existing analytical techniques, which offer flexible and broad-based methods of analysis and in some cases detection, have been discussed in this manuscript. There are a number of methods used, of which many are lab-based, but to our knowledge there seems to be no single technique that stands out above the rest, although analytical liquid chromatography, commonly linked with mass spectroscopy is likely to be popular. This review manuscript discusses (a) sample pre-treatment methods such as liquid-liquid extraction (LLE), supercritical fluid extraction (SFE), solid phase extraction (SPE), (b) separation methods such as (TLC), high performance liquid chromatography (HPLC), gas chromatography (GC), and capillary electrophoresis (CE) and (c) others such as ELISA. Further currents trends, advantages and disadvantages and future prospects of these methods have been discussed.},

@article{Maruyama1992,
abstract = {In order to find speed- and step-dependencies of temporal variability in gait, treadmill walking was examined in a speed range from 2 to 6 km/h and step rate from 60 to 160 steps/min. The duration of walking phases, i.e., stride cycle, step, stance, swing and double stance, were measured by using foot switches. Intrasubject variable error (VE) and coefficient of variation (CV) in each duration was regarded as an index of stability of gait within subjects. VE and CV decreased with walking speed in every phase, thereby supporting the hypothesis that faster movement is more stable than slower movement. CV in every phase was the least at the specific step rates which were linearly dependent on walking speed. The relationship between walking speed and step rate with the least CV was invariant among the different walking phases, and was close to that found in ‘free’ walk. There results suggest that the stability of gait in terms of CV in the duration of the walking phases is optimal for walking with freely chosen step rate at any given speed. The relevance of these findings to the optimality of the energy expenditure in walking is discussed.},

@article{Montero-Odasso2012,
abstract = {OBJECTIVE: To determine the effect of 2 different dual tasks on gait variability in people with mild cognitive impairment (MCI) compared with control subjects.

DESIGN: Cross-sectional study.

SETTING: Memory clinic at a university hospital.

PARTICIPANTS: Older adults with MCI (n=43) and cognitively normal control subjects (n=25) from the community. Gait was assessed under single (usual walking) and dual tasking (naming animals and subtracting serial 7s), using an electronic walkway.

INTERVENTIONS: Not applicable.

MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: The dependent variable was the coefficient of variation of gait variability, a marker of gait stability and an established risk factor for falls. Two-way repeated-measures analysis of variance was used to examine main effects (group, task) and their interaction.

RESULTS: A significant difference was found within and between groups (P=.016) of increasing gait variability as dual-task complexity increased. Gait velocity decreased within groups as dual-task complexity increased. The magnitude of increased gait variability across tasks was greater for the MCI group (2.68{\%}- 9.84{\%}) than for the control group (1.86{\%}-3.74{\%}), showing a significant between-group difference (P=.041).

CONCLUSIONS: Dual-task load significantly increased gait variability in the MCI group compared with the control group, an effect that was larger than the changes in gait velocity. The magnitude of this impairment on gait stability was related to the complexity of the dual task applied. Our findings help to explain the high risk of falls recently described in older adults with MCI, and may help in the identification of fall risk in cognitively impaired persons.},

@article{Karantonis2006,
abstract = {The real-time monitoring of human movement can provide valuable information regarding an individual's degree of functional ability and general level of activity. This paper presents the implementation of a real-time classification system for the types of human movement associated with the data acquired from a single, waist-mounted triaxial accelerometer unit. The major advance proposed by the system is to perform the vast majority of signal processing onboard the wearable unit using embedded intelligence. In this way, the system distinguishes between periods of activity and rest, recognizes the postural orientation of the wearer, detects events such as walking and falls, and provides an estimation of metabolic energy expenditure. A laboratory-based trial involving six subjects was undertaken, with results indicating an overall accuracy of 90.8{\%} across a series of 12 tasks (283 tests) involving a variety of movements related to normal daily activities. Distinction between activity and rest was performed without error; recognition of postural orientation was carried out with 94.1{\%} accuracy, classification of walking was achieved with less certainty (83.3{\%} accuracy), and detection of possible falls was made with 95.6{\%} accuracy. Results demonstrate the feasibility of implementing an accelerometry-based, real-time movement classifier using embedded intelligence.},
